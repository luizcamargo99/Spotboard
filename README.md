## 🚀 About this project

Software connected to Spotify API to generate Billboard-like Hot 100 list of a user's most listened songs.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Technologies 

Project created using .NET 7 / C# 11, running on Blazor WebAssembly. But make no mistake, I used JS as an ally for some things hehehe.

I used Visual Studio 2022 from the beginning of the release of this v1 and even deployed the application to Azure.
